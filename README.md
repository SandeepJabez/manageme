# manageme
ManageMe is a JavaFX project developed by Sandeep Jabez and Ishaan Chaturvedi. 
The aim of this project is to create two channels for patients depending on if the case is emergency or normal opd. We have created three windows and based on the class you belong to, we are able to calculate the tax and total bill.
